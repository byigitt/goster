   - get the channel id:
     - for public channels: use `@channelname`
     - for private channels: forward a message from the channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get the id

3. update your `.env.local` with the bot token and channel id

4. test the telegram connection:
   ```bash

   ```
